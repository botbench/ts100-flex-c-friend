| Amazon Basics USB-C PD | 30W           | 15V                 | 15V           | <ul><li>[Amazon.co.uk*](https://amzn.to/3afOhav)</li></ul> | Supports 20V, but does not have the current for it, switch must be switched to 15V. I tested the white one |
| UGREEN USB-C PD Charger | 18W           | 12V                 | Doesn't matter   | <ul><li>[Amazon.co.uk*](https://amzn.to/31JfMFt)</li></ul> | Only supports 12V, while it works, I recomend getting something more powerful |
